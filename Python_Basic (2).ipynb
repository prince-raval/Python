    "Q1.) What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that allows users to write instructions for a computer in a simple and readable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is popular because of several key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to read and write: Python has a clean and straightforward syntax.\n",
    "Open source: Freely available for everyone to use and modify.\n",
    "High-level language: Abstracts complex details of the computer's hardware.\n",
    "Portable: Code can run on different platforms without modification.\n",
    "Interpreted language: Executes code line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.\n",
    "Supports multiple programming paradigms: Both object-oriented and procedural styles are supported.\n",
    "Extensive standard library: Comes with many built-in modules and packages.\n",
    "Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types explicitly.\n",
    "Large community support: Active community provides lots of resources and help.\n",
    "Embeddable and extensible: Can be integrated with other languages like C/C++."

    "Q2.)  What is an interpreter in Python \n",
    "Ans - Python is an interpreted programming language, which means that the code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code all at once like C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter reads each line of the code, translates it into machine code, and then executes it immediately. This makes debugging easier and allows for quick testing and development."

    "\n",
    "These keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers because they are part of the core Python syntax.\n",

    "In Python:\n",
    ">>Mutable objects can be changed. Examples include: list, set, and dictionary.\n",
    ">>Immutable objects cannot be changed. Examples include: string, tuple, and int.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q6.) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
    "Ans-  In Python, lists are mutable because they are designed to store collections of items that may need to be updated, changed, or modified. You can add, remove, or change elements in a list after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This design makes tuples more memory-efficient and allows them to be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, which require immutable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mutability or immutability of these types is built into how they are implemented in Python."

    "Q9.) What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "Ans- Type casting in Python is the process of converting the type of a variable from one data type to another, if possible. It is used when you need to perform operations that require matching data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of type casting:\n",

    "\n",
    "Conditional statements help control the flow of a program. The most commonly used conditional statements are:\n",

    "Q12.) How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "Ans- The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions one by one after an initial if condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the if condition is False, Python moves to the elif and checks that condition. If it’s True, the corresponding block of code runs, and the rest of the conditions are skipped. You can use multiple elif statements in a row."
